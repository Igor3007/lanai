                                        .item-review__text Last week I called to inquire about the cost of the appraisal. They explained to me what would be done and showed me different types of screens from which I could choose. The work was completed in 2 days. They exceeded my expectations. Highly recommended. I'm very glad I chose Lanai101. Thank you
